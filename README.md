# Color Gradient Test
by electro707, 2025-06-07

This is a repository where I played around with color gradients, which I wrote [a blog post about](https://blogs.electro707.com/programming/2025/06/07/colorInterp.html)


# Files:
- dev.py: Internal dev stuff I was playing around with
- gen_mult.sh: A shell script that generates multiple images
- run.py: The main run file. Run --help to see arguments
- run_extra.py: Some extra stuff that uses `run.py`. Right now it only plots the interpolation functions
